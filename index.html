      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm a Pakistan-based <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with a strong foundation in backend development and a passion for building clean, scalable systems. Iâ€™ve worked in both professional and independent projects, using Java, Node.js, MongoDB, and Spring Boot.</p>
      <p>Recently, I co-developed <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/84505801550151/THE-HUNT-Panther-Tycoon">Panther Tycoon</a>, a Roblox multiplayer game with over <strong>17000 plays</strong> at the time of writing. I've also worked as a Backend Engineer at Liquid Technologies where I played a key role in the development of the backend system for <a href="https://roam-trips.com/">Roam Trips</a>, a trip-planning e-commerce platform.</p></p>
      <p>I'm currently looking for full-time roles in software engineering, especially backend or full-stack development.</p>
